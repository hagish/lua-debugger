Requirements
============
To build successfully you need at least wxWidgets 2.6.1 (stable).


Generel building rules
======================
First build or get the wxWidgets libraries however this is done on your platform.
If the libraries don't use the standard development paths you _have_ to set the
$WXSTABLE environment variable to point to the base directory of wxWidgets (i.e.
"/usr/src/wxWidgets" then "WXSTABLE=/usr/src/wxWidgets").


Building on Unix (wxGTK, wxUniv)
================================
wxGTK: Use "make" for the release version, "make debug" for the debug version,
"make univdebug" for the univ debug version.


Building on Windows (wxMSW, wxUniv)
===================================
There is a VC++ project file which requires the environment variable WXSTABLE
pointing to the correct locations (i.e. "C:\Devel\wxWidgets" then
"WXSTABLE=C:\Devel\wxWidgets").


Building on other ports
=======================
There is currently no support to build on other ports. If you are able to deduct
how to build on your platform it would be nice if you submit them to the project.
